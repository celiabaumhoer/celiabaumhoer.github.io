About me
======
I am a passionate postdoctoral remote sensing scientist and geographer with an interest in polar and cold regions, particularly Antarctica and the mountain cryosphere. By using high-volume earth observation data and artificial intelligence I create a better understanding of long-term climate change impacts on the cryosphere and predict possible future scenarios. During my doctorate at the Julius-Maximilians-University Würzburg and the German Aerospace Center (DLR), I developed a CNN-based algorithm to automatically detect glacier and ice shelf front positions from SAR satellite imagery along the Antarctic coastline.\
\
Fascinated by snow and ice, I currently work in the group “Polar and Cold Regions” at DLR on several projects to detect, monitor and quantify the impacts of climate change in Alpine and polar regions (e.g. [AI-CORE](https://ai-core.eoc.dlr.de/), [Lakes4Antarctica](https://lakes4antarctica.eoc.dlr.de/), [AI4Snow](https://ai4snow.eoc.dlr.de/), [TerraByteDNN2Sim]( https://dnn2sim.de/)). I am also involved in science communication and teaching, developed an operational product [IceLines](https://geoservice.dlr.de/web/maps/eoc:icelines), chaired sessions on AI and big data for cryosphere research at international conferences and received several awards for my work (e.g. [DLR Science Award 2022](https://event.dlr.de/awards/dlr-wissenschaftspreis/#1716197403114-89872fca-4886), [Helmholtz Doctoral Prize 2021]( https://www.helmholtz.de/newsroom/artikel/promotionspreis-fuer-sechs-nachwuchstalente/)). \
\
In my free time, I observe the effects of climate change in mountain regions not only from space but also in the field as a mountaineer and by guiding tours for the German Alpine Club (DAV).
