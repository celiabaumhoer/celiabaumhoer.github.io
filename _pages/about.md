About me
======
I am a passionate postdoctoral remote sensing scientist and geographer with an interest in polar and cold regions, particularly Antarctica and the mountain cryosphere. By using earth observation data and artificial intelligence I create a better understanding of long-term climate change impacts on the cryosphere and predict possible future scenarios. To communicate research results to society I engage in teaching and science communication.
